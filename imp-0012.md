Abstract
--------

An extension to the capacity announcement format that includes definitions of 
identities allowed for direct claim access coupled with null or zero storage 
and download payment price would enable users to provide an allocation of 
donated capacity to chosen organizations. Additionally, a semi-trusted registry 
of identities would enable users to easily configure nodes to donate capacity 
to these organizations.
