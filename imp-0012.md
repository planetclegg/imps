Abstract
--------

The definition of a series of flags corresponding to various historical 
behavior criteria of nodes would enable directories to develop a "soft" 
reputation score for farmers. This paired with a signaling mechanism for 
directories to identify each other would enable the sharing of scores with the 
network at large. This would allow for the processing of reputation data using 
a collaborative filtering mechanism to establish a rolling consensus on the 
behavior and reliability of network participants.
