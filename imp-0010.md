Title: User Defined Object Access Control

Abstract
--------

An extension to the ORC contract and shard descriptor specification that 
instructs data custodians to ignore the standard strict access control in favor 
of user defined access control would allow for objects stored in the ORC 
network to be made publicly or selectively accessible to other idendities. In 
addition, the specification of a shareable URI format would enable object 
pointers to be stored within the ORC DHT and provide the groundwork for 
user-friendly lookup and retrieval of objects.

### Contract Policies Extension



### Writing Object Pointers



### Magnet URI Scheme

Once the object pointer has been stored in the DHT, it can be represented for 
lookup using a standard 
[Magnet URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_URI_scheme) scheme. ORC 
magnets require 3 parameters to be valid: 

* `xt` (exact topic) - `urn:orc:{hash}`
* `x.ecprv` (private key) - `{key}`
* `x.pword` (pointer password) - `{key}`

> Optionally, the size and name of the object referenced by the pointer may be 
> added as the `xl` (exact length) and `dn` (display name) parameters, 
> respectively. 

The value of the `{hash}` placeholder in the URN example above must be the hex 
encoded RIPEMD-160 hash of the SHA-256 hash of the encrypted object pointer to 
which it is in reference. The value of the `x.ecprv` parameter must be the hex 
encoded 32 byte EC private key required to decrypt the object to which the 
pointer is in reference. the value the `x.pword` parameter must be the hex 
encoded AES-256 cipher key used to encrypt the object pointer.

Given an object pointer:

```
{
  "name": "README.md",
  "size": 3229
  "encoding": "7bit",
  "mimetype": "text/plain",
  "ecpub": "03fde34849918edde3870bdff2c8f80a741e8955458d6430723e98ff6aad0b68d8",
  "hash": "877167565af0376f2fddb170ad0483f91e9b932d72052720ae15efeb8ec2b010",
  "shards": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "size": 1616,
      "hash": "18b42cc5da5b3d4bb4f32bc7e5d9d66c28ed1df8",
      "service": [
        "58cde082962e4d7c10c29c344efb0be7724514be",
        {
          "protocol": "https:"
          "hostname": "xf6zfozlg44mwizu.onion",
          "port": 443,
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "index": 1,
      "size": 1616,
      "hash": "a519fc67c54717a75b8f0898bfb4ffb90c109f20",
      "service": [
        "8e125394ab60a24a44f6c622881497e961920393",
        {
          "protocol": "https:",
          "hostname": "dphzfwpok5pg3zrt.onion",
          "port": 443
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "index": 2,
      "size": 1616,
      "hash": "dde3c7a7bf1a3685ce2b15bb1f62b8f020746162",
      "service": [
        "45818c9ee3f5af0961b6eee78daf0f530d61b12d",
        {
          "protocol": "https:",
          "hostname": "yn6rq6akhlgdbbel.onion",
          "port": 443
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This object pointer is encrypted using AES-256 with the 20 byte key 
`516de2b6d709313314eedb62d6c366884ad0425f`, and the referenced object is 
encrypted using ECDH from `ecpub` to an arbitrary private key 
`d9a5d645a543564d0127e8462bb01fd1b5586a34f67c8fa2dbafc89b091c2e1e` the 
resulting ORC magnet URI would be::

```
magnet:?xt=urn:orc:8c9f17eaf941c3f9f66cbc39f301a6dbc2a1f876
&xs=3229
&dn=README.md
&x.ecprv=d9a5d645a543564d0127e8462bb01fd1b5586a34f67c8fa2dbafc89b091c2e1e
```

> Note that `xs` and `dn` are included in the example above but are optional.

Given this information, an ORC node can perform a content-addressable lookup in 
the DHT for `8c9f17eaf941c3f9f66cbc39f301a6dbc2a1f876` to discover the object 
pointer. Once the pointer is obtained, it can be decrypted with the value of 
`x.pword` and provided that the requester has the appropriate authorization as 
defined in each shard's associated contract, the shards can be retrieved from 
the network and the object can be decrypted using ECDH given the `ecprv` in 
the URI and the `ecpub` defined in the pointer itself.
