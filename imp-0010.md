Title: User Defined Object Access Control

Abstract
--------

An extension to the ORC contract and shard descriptor specification that 
instructs data custodians to ignore the standard strict access control in favor 
of user defined access control would allow for objects stored in the ORC 
network to be made publicly or selectively accessible to other idendities. In 
addition, the specification of a shareable URI format would enable public 
object pointers to be stored within the ORC DHT and provide the groundwork for 
user-friendly lookup and retrieval of public objects.
